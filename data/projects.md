## AgentVerse Hackathon (UCL London, Nov 2025)

Collaborated with a team of 6 to build an **AI onboarding agent** that answers FAQs, drafts HR/IT emails, and reduces manager workload. Integrated GitHub and Slack APIs to ground responses in current projects and organizational updates. Prototyped an Anam AI voice avatar for conversational onboarding. Produced and published a creative pitch video on YouTube to showcase the agent's capabilities.

**Tech**: AI/LLM integration, GitHub API, Slack API, voice avatar (Anam AI).

**Outcomes**: Demonstrated end-to-end integration of multiple APIs and AI for a real HR use case; strong team collaboration and fast prototyping.

## Hackabot (Robosoc Society Manchester, Mar 2024 – Mar 2025)

Collaborated in a team of 4 to program Mona bots to solve maze challenges. In 2024, coordinated two bots to communicate and collaboratively map the maze using onboard sensors. In 2025, explored computer-vision-based navigation for a sensor-less bot for reliable route following. Sharpened vibe coding skills.

**Tech**: Embedded C / robotics, sensors, computer vision (for sensor-less bot), multi-robot coordination.

**Outcomes**: Team coordination, sensor fusion, and adapting to constraints (sensor-less navigation).

## Embedded Systems Project – Line-following buggy (University of Manchester, Sept 2024 – Jun 2025)

Led a team of 5 and served as **lead coder** for a line-following buggy. Implemented embedded firmware with a **PID control algorithm** on the microcontroller. Authored design documentation, test plans, and final reports; presented results to stakeholders. Supported teammates through code reviews, task delegation, and workflow coordination. Designed chassis layout and sensor placement; produced wiring diagrams and integrated motors, sensors, and MCU. Managed budget and component selection; created promotional materials and a pitch.

**Tech**: Embedded C, PID control, microcontrollers, sensors, motors, VHDL/digital design (as per degree modules).

**Outcomes**: End-to-end ownership from design to delivery; clear documentation and presentation; team leadership.

## Quantum algorithms – Shor's algorithm (University of Manchester, Sep 2025 – Jun 2026)

**University of Manchester project** (Sep 2025 – Jun 2026, in progress). The methodology combines self-directed study of quantum computing foundations with practical hands-on experimentation. Theoretical work covers quantum gates, superposition, interference, and entanglement and how they enable quantum speed-up in **Shor's algorithm**. Implementation uses **Python** and the **Qiskit** quantum computing framework; circuits are designed from the standard Shor's formulation, with circuit diagrams for visualisation and to determine gate count and sequence. Measurement operations convert quantum states to classical outcomes for analysis. Circuits are tested on both **Qiskit simulators** and **real quantum hardware** on IBM's online platform. A classical counterpart in Python acts as a baseline. Performance metrics include total execution time, resources (qubits, circuit depth, total gates), and scalability as problem size increases. A report is expected to be finished by **June 2026**.

**Tech**: Python, Qiskit, IBM Quantum platform, quantum algorithms, number theory.

**Outcomes**: Blended learning (theory + implementation); design, simulation, and execution on IBM hardware; comparison with classical baseline; report in progress (June 2026).

## Lattice Semiconductor Internship (Penang, Malaysia, Jun – Sept 2025)

- Supported **LPDDR4/DDR3 software IP** in the DDR technology team.
- Automated **pin assignment** for development boards with a custom script, speeding setup and reducing errors.
- Restructured example projects for easier customization and faster customer adoption.
- Identified and resolved **critical bugs** in DDR3 IP, improving reliability ahead of release.

**Outcomes**: Direct contribution to product reliability and developer experience; script and process improvements.

## AMD Internship (Penang, Malaysia, Jun – Sept 2024)

- Automated **PCIe endpoint capability extraction** using Bash on Linux, accelerating diagnostics and performance analysis.
- Developed a **Python tool** to compare and validate register values across devices and configurations, flagging mismatches early for data integrity and faster debug.
- Integrated both tools into the team workflow, reducing manual steps and increasing repeatability.

**Outcomes**: Tangible impact on team efficiency; adoption of automation in a production workflow.
