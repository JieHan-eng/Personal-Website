# About Jie Han Oh

I'm **Jie Han Oh**, 22, from **Malaysia**. I'm an Electronic Engineer from the **University of Manchester**, on track for First-Class Honours (Year 1: 88%, Year 2: 81%).

## Summary

Dynamic and innovative Engineer with a diverse portfolio: Silicon validation, AI agents, and autonomous robotics.

I combine a rigorous analytical approach with creative problem-solving to enhance workflows and optimize embedded systems. Experienced in leading cross-functional teams and communicating technical results to stakeholders. Eager to leverage a fast-learning mindset in a 2026 graduate engineering role.

## Background

I've interned at **Lattice Semiconductor** and **AMD** (both in Penang, Malaysia).

At Lattice: DDR IP support, pin assignment automation, and critical bug fixes. At AMD: PCIe capability extraction and register comparison tools. I use Bash, Python, Embedded C, and Unix/Linux to streamline diagnostics and development workflows.

## What I like to build

- **Embedded systems** — Firmware, PID control, sensor integration, hardware–software co-design.
- **Automation & tooling** — Scripts and tools that reduce manual steps (e.g. PCIe extraction, pin assignment, register validation).
- **Hackathon projects** — AI agents, API integrations (GitHub, Slack), and quick end-to-end prototypes.

## Why I'm different

I combine **rigorous engineering** (digital systems, computer architecture, DSP, control systems) with **practical delivery**.

I've led teams, written design docs and test plans, and coordinated workflows. I'm comfortable in low-level embedded work and higher-level integration—so I can own a problem from idea to shipped solution.

## Education

- **BEng Electronic Engineering**, University of Manchester (Sept 2023 – July 2026). First-Class track. Key modules: Digital Systems Design (VHDL), Embedded Systems (C), Computer Architecture, DSP, Control Systems, High-Speed Digital & Mixed-Signal. Main projects: line-following buggy (PID on MCU); report on Shor's algorithm.
- **A-Levels**, Kolej Yayasan UEM (KYUEM), Malaysia — 1A* & 3A's (Further Maths A*, Maths, Physics, Chemistry).
- **Cambridge IGCSE**, Wesley Methodist School Penang International — 7 A* & 2 A's.

## Skills
