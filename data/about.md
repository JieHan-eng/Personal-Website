# About Jie Han Oh

**Jie Han Oh** is from **Malaysia** and is an Electronic Engineer from the **University of Manchester**, on track for First-Class Honours.

## Summary

Dynamic and innovative Engineer with a diverse portfolio: Silicon validation, AI agents, and autonomous robotics.

Combines a rigorous analytical approach with creative problem-solving to enhance workflows and optimize embedded systems. Experienced in leading cross-functional teams and communicating technical results to stakeholders. Eager to leverage a fast-learning mindset in a 2026 graduate engineering role.

## Background

Completed internships at **Lattice Semiconductor** and **AMD** (both in Penang, Malaysia).

At Lattice: DDR IP support, pin assignment automation, and critical bug fixes. At AMD: PCIe capability extraction and register comparison tools. Uses Bash, Python, Embedded C, and Unix/Linux to streamline diagnostics and development workflows.

## Focus areas

- **Embedded systems** — Firmware, PID control, sensor integration, hardware–software co-design.
- **Automation & tooling** — Scripts and tools that reduce manual steps (e.g. PCIe extraction, pin assignment, register validation).
- **Quantum computing** — Self-directed study and implementation (e.g. Shor's algorithm with Qiskit and IBM Quantum).
- **Hackathon projects** — AI agents, API integrations (GitHub, Slack), and quick end-to-end prototypes.

## Differentiators

Combines **rigorous engineering** (digital systems, computer architecture, DSP, control systems) with **practical delivery**.

Has led teams, authored design docs and test plans, and coordinated workflows. Comfortable in low-level embedded work and higher-level integration—able to own a problem from idea to shipped solution.

Leverages **vibe coding** and AI-assisted development: uses modern tools (Copilot, LLMs, quick iteration loops) to accelerate firmware, scripting, and documentation without sacrificing correctness. Treats AI as a force multiplier for hardware and embedded work—rapid prototyping, clearer docs, and faster debug—while retaining deep thinking and validation. This mix of traditional engineering discipline and modern tooling defines his approach to a 2026 graduate role.
